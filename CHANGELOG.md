## Phase 2 — ML Sidecar + Forensic Pipeline

### Weeks 17-18 — Deepfake / AI-Generated Image Detection (2 Mar 2026)

**Added**
- Statistical feature ensemble for detecting AI-generated images — 6 feature extractors (frequency domain FFT, noise residual, colour/texture, LBP+GLCM, JPEG DCT artefacts, edge analysis) combined via 8 weighted heuristic signals
- `POST /forensics/deepfake` endpoint returning score, confidence, signal breakdown, and frequency spectrum heatmap
- `DeepfakeSignal` and `DeepfakeResult` Rust structs + `detect_deepfake()` sidecar client method (60s timeout)
- Deepfake detection wired into verify pipeline with graceful degradation
- AI Generation Detection section on verify page with heatmap, summary, expandable signal list, confidence indicator
- Deepfake capability shown on dashboard sidecar status
- `DeepfakeSignal` and `DeepfakeResult` TypeScript interfaces
- 10 Python deepfake tests, 2 Rust deserialization tests
- Dependencies: `scikit-image>=0.24`, `scipy>=1.14`

**Changed**
- Updated `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — corrected port (1420), updated module tables, added sidecar services table, rewrote verify pipeline diagram

**Test counts**: 84 Rust, 35 Python, 0 svelte-check errors

### Weeks 15-16 — Noise Analysis + Copy-Move Detection (1 Mar 2026)

**Added**
- Block-wise noise variance analysis service (`noise_analysis.py`) — Laplacian filter + MAD-based outlier detection with JET colourmap heatmap
- Copy-move forgery detection service (`copy_move.py`) — ORB keypoints + BFMatcher self-matching + DBSCAN clustering with visualisation
- `POST /forensics/noise` and `POST /forensics/copy-move` endpoints
- `NoiseResult`, `CloneRegion`, `CopyMoveResult` Rust structs + client methods
- Noise and copy-move wired into verify pipeline; all forensic scores averaged for trust computation
- Noise Analysis and Copy-Move Detection sections on verify page
- Extracted `_read_and_validate()` shared helper in forensics.py
- Extracted `build_image_form()` shared helper in sidecar.rs
- 8 noise analysis tests, 7 copy-move tests, 3 Rust deserialization tests
- Dependency: `scikit-learn>=1.5`

**Changed**
- Refactored trust computation from ELA-only to generic `forensic_signals` vec averaging all available signals
- Renamed `elaScoreClass`/`elaScoreBgClass` to `forensicScoreClass`/`forensicScoreBgClass`

**Test counts**: 82 Rust, 25 Python, 0 svelte-check errors

### Weeks 13-14 — Sidecar Bridge + ELA + URL Verification (28 Feb 2026)

**Added**
- Python ML sidecar (FastAPI on port 8200) with health endpoint and ELA service
- Error Level Analysis service (`ela.py`) — JPEG recompression difference with heatmap
- `POST /forensics/ela` endpoint
- Rust `SidecarClient` with `is_available()`, `check_health()`, `analyse_ela()` methods
- ELA wired into verify pipeline with graceful degradation
- ELA result section on verify page with heatmap, statistics, suspicious warning
- URL verification via `verify_url` Tauri command — downloads content to temp file and runs through pipeline
- URL tab on verify page with input field
- Sidecar health status badge on verify page and dashboard
- `SidecarHealth`, `SidecarCapabilities`, `ElaResult` TypeScript interfaces
- Browser mock fallback in `api.ts` for `checkSidecarHealth()`
- 7 ELA tests, 3 health tests, 6 Rust sidecar tests

**Test counts**: 76 Rust, 10 Python, 0 svelte-check errors

## Phase 1 — Core MVP

### Weeks 1-12 — PROTECT + VERIFY Foundation (27 Feb 2026)

**Added**
- Tauri v2 desktop shell with SvelteKit frontend (SPA mode, static adapter)
- Dark-mode UI with mineral colour palette (Obsidian, Graphite, Lapis, Malachite, Amber, Cinnabar)
- Four-tab navigation: PROTECT, VERIFY, MONITOR (placeholder), SETTINGS (placeholder)
- **PROTECT pipeline**: file import via drag-and-drop + native dialog, format detection (image/document/video/audio/3D/web), EXIF metadata extraction, image dimension reading, SQLite storage, audit logging
- **C2PA Content Credentials**: sign assets with ES256 self-signed certificates, read and verify manifests, signed output path management
- **Perceptual fingerprinting**: aHash, dHash, pHash via image_hasher crate, Hamming distance similarity search, fingerprint storage
- **EXIF anomaly detection**: 12 checks (timestamps, GPS, software, dimensions), severity levels (info/low/medium/high/critical), trust score computation
- **Format router**: MIME detection via `infer` crate with extension fallback, content type classification
- **VERIFY pipeline**: file drop + file dialog, EXIF analysis, C2PA manifest reading, trust score with findings display
- **SQLite database**: assets, fingerprints, verifications, audit_log tables with operator_id and algorithm_metadata
- **Dashboard**: stats grid (assets, signed, fingerprints, verifications), recent assets list, quick action cards
- **PROTECT page**: asset table with filtering (content type, signed status, search), bulk import, C2PA signing dialog, fingerprint viewer, similarity search, asset deletion
- Tiered cataloguing architecture (Tier 1: EXIF, Tier 2: CLIP/ONNX optional, Tier 3: Ollama optional)
- Three-tier AI design with no mandatory external dependencies
- Docker Compose setup and GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows

**Test counts**: 70 Rust, 0 svelte-check errors
